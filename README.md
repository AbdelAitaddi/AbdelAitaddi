> **ApartmentSearch** is a project that provides a practical introduction to NgRx Signal Store for modern, high-performance state management and serves as a starting point for gaining a deeper understanding of essential Angular concepts that improve application scalability, user-friendliness, and maintainability.
> All components are fully Signal-driven, and the application is zoneless.
> <p align="center"><img width="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdelAitaddi/angular-zoneless-ngrxSignalStore/refs/heads/master/screenshots/screenshot.png" alt="App Screenshot"/></p>
> The goal of this app is to introduce how to use NgRx Signal Store state management solution in Zoneless Signal-Based Component Architecture, with a focus on maintaining sustainable development speed and the ease of adding new features in the long run.
> 
> The user can search for apartments by the desired city and district, view detailed information about a selected apartment, and mark it as a favorite. Additionally, the app offers features such as language switching and more.

> Built using Angular CLI 19.2.0 & Json-server.

#### 💥 [Angular-zoneless-pwa-indexedDB (offline first todo App) ](https://github.com/AbdelAitaddi/angular-zoneless-pwa-indexedDB) 💥

> **Taskly** is a project designed to get started with Angular Signals, async reactivity with Resources, Dexie.js (IndexedDB), and Progressive Web Application (PWA) development for modern, high-performance state management. It includes:
>
> - Dexie.js as a wrapper for IndexedDB for efficient local storage.
> - PWA (Progressive Web App) allows users to access and interact with the app even when offline.
> - Background Sync automatically synchronizes pending CRUD operations with the backend when the network is restored.
> <p align="center"><img width="80%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AbdelAitaddi/angular-zoneless-pwa-indexedDB/refs/heads/master/screenshots/mobile.png" alt="App Screenshot"/></p>
> The goal of this app is to introduce how to transform an Angular application into a PWA, ensuring a seamless user experience even when offline. It leverages Dexie.js for local storage and Background Sync for automatic data synchronization.
>
> Users can create, update, and delete data without an active internet connection. Once they go back online, all pending changes are automatically synchronized with the backend.

> Built using Angular CLI 19.2.0 & Json-server.
